Don’t watch this off-beat jukebox cartoon expecting any conventional soccer action. Equal parts Disney, Dali and Duchamp, this abstract mix of black and white photos and alternative comix style animation is accompanied by a medley of doo-wop classics and documentary soundbites.  The film is certainly an extreme departure for those familiar with the more conventional output of the Halas & Batchelor studio, best known for their feature-length version of George Orwell’s Animal Farm (1954). Paul Vester was one of a number of sixties art school graduates that brought a mix of pop art and illustration influences to the company whilst it was undergoing a brief change in its ownership. As a warning, in keeping with its progressive, adult style there is some brief nudity at the end of the film.\n2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Aftermath was the pilot for an unsold TV series called The Code of Jonathan West; it aired as part of The General Electric Theater. The film takes place just after the Civil War, in a small southern town – war-ravaged, impoverished, and seething with hatred and resentment.\n3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Gosho’s most celebrated film both in Japan and the West, Where Chimneys Are Seen is perhaps the most compelling example of his concern for, and insights into, the everyday lives of lower-middle-class people. Based on Rinzo Shiina’s novel of the absurd, the film depicts the lives of two couples against the backdrop of Tokyo’s growing industrialization during the 1950s.\n4                                                  Carl Wagner's good wife was dying. His heart bled at the thought of losing her, his life-long loyal helpmate. And his opera was almost completed, after spending months of weary hours to make it perfect. A pretty daughter tried in vain to brighten the overhanging gloom. Finally the composer, after a superhuman effort, and with a soul filled with sorrow, finished the last act of his score and hurried away to the impresario for a hearing. Here he was assured of an immediate reading and the return to his humble tenement was made with a much lighter heart. The doctor paid another visit to his patient and left a prescription to be filled. Carl reached home and realized how much depended upon the medicine ordered to possibly save a life most dear. Taking his cherished violin, the only article of value remaining, he rushed off to the pawnbroker and negotiated a loan.\n5 50 Years of Fabulous recounts the rich history of the Imperial Council, the oldest LGBT charity organization in the world. Founded in San Francisco by renown activist, drag queen and performer Jose Sarria, the Council has helped shaped LGBT life and social history in San Francisco and beyond throughout the last five decades. Sarria was also the first openly gay man to run for political office in the United States in 1961.  From its genesis as a critical public space for the community and capacity building of LGBT San Franciscans, to its vital role in the advocacy for LGBT human rights, 50 YEARS OF FABULOUS documents the full scope of the organization’s historical evolution up to its contemporary struggle in finding relevance -- both in the wake of social progress it has helped foster, and in light of a newly empowered political coalition committed to rolling back a half-century of civil rights achievements.\n6                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               A divorced couple's teen-age daughter stands trial for stabbing her mother's latest lover.\n  popularity         production_countries release_date runtime spoken_languages\n1        0.6           [\"United Kingdom\"]   1971-12-05       0               []\n2        0.6                           []   1960-04-17      22               []\n3      1.568                    [\"Japan\"]   1953-03-05     108       [\"日本語\"]\n4        0.6 [\"United States of America\"]   1911-12-12      15               []\n5        0.6                           []   2018-05-17      75               []\n6      2.304 [\"United States of America\"]   1964-11-02     111      [\"English\"]\n  tmdb_id                                tmdb_link vote_average vote_count\n1  535272 https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/535272/            0          0\n2  318331 https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/318331/            8          1\n3  117779 https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/117779/          6.6         10\n4  560377 https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/560377/            0          0\n5  525187 https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/525187/            0          0\n6   73348  https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/73348/          6.1         11\n  year_released\n1          1971\n2          1960\n3          1953\n4          1911\n5          2018\n6          1964"
